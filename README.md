🚢 Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning

This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **data cleaning** on the Titanic dataset from the famous [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). The goal is to understand the key features that influenced passenger survival and prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling.
---
 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand the structure and content of the Titanic dataset
- Perform data cleaning: handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns
- Perform exploratory data analysis:
  - Survival rates by sex, class, age, family size, etc.
  - Correlation between variables
- Engineer new features (e.g., Title extraction, FamilySize)
- Prepare the dataset for machine learning models

🧪 Dataset Description

The dataset is split into:

- `train.csv`: used to build models (includes `Survived` target)
- `test.csv`: used to predict survival (ground truth not included)
- `gender_submission.csv`: baseline submission assuming all females survived

Key variables

| Variable    | Description                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| `Survived`  | Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)            |
| `Pclass`    | Passenger Class (1 = 1st, 3 = 3rd)    |
| `Sex`       | Gender                                |
| `Age`       | Age in years                          |
| `SibSp`     | Siblings/Spouses aboard               |
| `Parch`     | Parents/Children aboard               |
| `Fare`      | Ticket Fare                           |
| `Embarked`  | Port of Embarkation (C/Q/S)           |

📊 Key EDA Insights

- **Sex**: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- **Pclass**: 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate.
- **Age**: Younger children had higher survival rates.
- **FamilySize**: Having 1–3 family members increased survival chances.
- **Title**: Titles like "Mrs", "Miss", and "Master" indicated higher survival.

🧹 Features Engineered
Title: Extracted from the Name column
FamilySize: Calculated from SibSp + Parch + 1
Converted Sex and Embarked to numeric
Handled missing values in Age, Embarked, and dropped Cabin
